 * - The first level keys are arbitrary strings representing item names.
 * - The second level keys are arbitrary strings representing the character name the item is currently on.
 * - The third level is a mapping where keys are Location and the values are numbers, representing specific counts for location.
 *
 * Use this structure to associate multiple levels of categorized data with a numerical representation for different locations.
